If you wish to static host this follow the instructions below.

### Static Hosting

For this example I am going to be using cloudflare pages. You can use other static hosts aswell since they should have similar instructions.

**Step 1**: Go to [pages.dev](https://pages.dev) or your cloudflare dashboard and navigate to pages and workers
<br>
**Step 2**: Next Fork this repository and authorize cloudflare to have access to your github repos.
<br>
**Step 3**: Once you've done that select the Pages catagory and select the fusion github repo and click next
<br>
**Step 4**: In the build settings in the "Output Directory" section set it to `fusion-static\` and select deploy
<br>
**Step 5**: Make sure that your page deployed succesfully by visiting the url of the deployment
